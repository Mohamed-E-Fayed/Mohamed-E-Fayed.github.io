My midterm grades story this semester is inspiring for me, and I hope it would be so for you as well.


I have taken AI Ethics and Society course and significant parts of its content were inaccessible.
Since most of the midterm was inaccessible, I initially scored 26/78.
I have agreed upon with Teaching Assistants to make my own version based on my own research and understanding about that content. This could be a reasonable method to prove that I understand that part and get credit for that.
After doing some search and paying some effort, I succeeded in writing accessible articles about Anscombeâ€™s Quartet, Misleading Graphs and Fairness Metrics.
TAs were grateful for this effort and I my midterm credit increased to be 71/78.
Ultimately, The whole course ended up with â€˜Aâ€™, and thatâ€™s good news. ðŸŽ‰

This short story has been inspiring for me because:

1. I am more encouraged to redesign masters and doctoral methods of teaching students with disabilities.
I hope also it would be useful for all other professors and blind students to truly consider recreating the content as a method of giving credit to blind students. This is crucial especially in Masters and Doctorate because of the frequent updates to courses contents.
2. It shows how much credit can a blind student lose due to inaccessible content.
3. I hope what I wrote would be beneficial to upcoming blind students.
4. As always, I am committed to solving my problems in my own way.

Special thanks to dr Mahendar Mandala, Head TAs Tanya Churaman andÂ Vijayakumar Sivanesan, and all other TAs for their support to make this story a success.

Of course, I also canâ€™t thank Allah (my God) enough for his invaluable support in every possible way to be the person I am today.
