Sometimes, colleagues ask me: "How do you work?" or "What tools do you use?".
Other times, I feel them asking themselves these questions and fear to annoy me asking for that.

In this article, I explain what tools do I use in my everyday work routines.

## Where it all begins

In the college, a teaching assistant once asked me: "Why don't you use terminal? You can use it to do everything in text based interface.".
That was a very interesting to me since blind people are usually suffering from poor accessibility of widely used applications.
If you are signed in to any mailing list or forums for the blind, you can always see questions like "Is there an application to convert mov to mp4 video formats?".
Moreover, exploring new Graphical User Interface is a long process, and usually is different experience from an app to another.
That's why I found this question pretty interesting and started searching for how to do it.

That was in 2016.
I was choosing between Mac OS and Windos OS.
I found Linux back then pretty basic and don't cover my multilingual needs as an Arabic and English speaker.
Since WSL was not a thing, the obvious choice was Mac OS.
At worst case scenario, I may install Windows as my main OS or via Bootcamp and stop using Mac OS entirely.

## Early Days

I decided to buy my first Macbook Pro in Summer 2017, and started learning about Xcode and Terminal.
During Summer Internship in 2018, a colleague told me that I can use vim as my main editor.
I gave it a try, and its learning curve was a little steep.
Because of being comparable to Visual Studio Code, which was not accessible enough that days, I decided to learn vim more and more.
And guess what? It's my main editor and its variant NeoVim.

By the time, I was searching for doing stuff via terminal.
I was asking Google Search questions like: "How to convert mov to mp4", and make sure to append "in terminal".
Sometimes, I need Mac specific answers, and mostly linux solutions were working as well.

I got impressed by wide variety of software I could use free of charge via terminal.
I got used to the terminal in doing everything.
I was able to do commands like
```bash
$ brew install ffmpeg
$ ffmpeg -i file.mov file.m4a
```
That was the turning point where I decided to leave GUI entirely, even IDEs.

## What is my Workflow using Terminal and Browser?

Back to why you are here, and how do I use terminal and browser only.

## Do I need any other applications?
