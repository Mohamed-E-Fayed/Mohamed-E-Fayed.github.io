    <p>My midterm grades story this semester is inspiring for me, and I hope it would be so for you as well.</p>

<p>I have taken AI Ethics and Society course and significant parts of its content were inaccessible.
Since most of the midterm was inaccessible, I initially scored 26/78.
I have agreed upon with Teaching Assistants to make my own version based on my own research and understanding about that content. This could be a reasonable method to prove that I understand that part and get credit for that.
After doing some search and paying some effort, I succeeded in writing accessible articles about Anscombeâ€™s Quartet, Misleading Graphs and Fairness Metrics.
TAs were grateful for this effort and I my midterm credit increased to be 71/78.
Ultimately, The whole course ended up with â€˜Aâ€™, and thatâ€™s good news. ðŸŽ‰</p>

<p>This short story has been inspiring for me because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am more encouraged to redesign masters and doctoral methods of teaching students with disabilities.
I hope also it would be useful for all other professors and blind students to truly consider recreating the content as a method of giving credit to blind students. This is crucial especially in Masters and Doctorate because of the frequent updates to courses contents.</li>
  <li>It shows how much credit can a blind student lose due to inaccessible content.</li>
  <li>I hope what I wrote would be beneficial to upcoming blind students.</li>
  <li>As always, I am committed to solving my problems in my own way.</li>
</ol>

<p>Special thanks to dr Mahendar Mandala, Head TAs Tanya Churaman andÂ Vijayakumar Sivanesan, and all other TAs for their support to make this story a success.</p>

<p>Of course, I also canâ€™t thank Allah (my God) enough for his invaluable support in every possible way to be the person I am today.</p>
