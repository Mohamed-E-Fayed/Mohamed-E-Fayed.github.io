[Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is a concept that unifies statistics, analytics and algorithms with data to study real phenomena.
I consider it a large umbrella that includes learning topics like mathematics, Statistics, visualization techniques, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning.
Those topics introduce different challenges to any blind person who wants to learn those topics or work in the field.
In this article, I list those problems and my way of approaching them.
It is based on many trials and errors and community help.
