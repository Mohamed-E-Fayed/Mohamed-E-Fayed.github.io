[Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) is a field interested in systems interacting with human language.
Its tasks are divided into Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG).
In this article, I explain the evaluation metrics developed to assess the quality of NLG models and the intuition behind them.
If you are interested in NLU tasks, which are classification applications by nature, you may check my article: [Classification Metrics: A Cheatsheet](https://mohamed-e-fayed.github.io/docs/machine%20learning/classification/metrics/2024/08/14/classification-metrics.html).

For the sake of understanding the whole landscape, I will focus on Machine Translation problem as an example for NLG task, and refer to other problems as well.
If you have interest in Large Language Models and evaluating its output, you may proceed to the below section of [Evaluating Instruction Fine-tuning](#eval-llm).

Note: I believe that every researcher has to understand the reason why we needed an metric and the design choices lead to each one.
This is crucial since it significantly affects the output of your system and effectiveness of your research overall.
So, you will find me digging into details for a good reason.

## <a id="background">Background</a>
[Machine Translation (MT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation) is one of the [oldest problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_machine_translation) in [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence).
It is concerned with automatically converting text from one human language to another.
For example, you want to translate Chinese sentence into English or vice versa.
This should be done automatically using computers.

The part of interest of this story starts in 2002, by the introduction of [BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation](#papineni2002).
If you have Chinese sentence, English translation, and model output in English, you may compare the generated output with reference translation (which is English in this case).
This algorithm has been the de facto metric to compare among [MT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation) systems till the introduction of first neural metric of [BERT Score](#zhang2019).
Attention has shifted towards neural networks as metrics since they exhibit higher correlations with human judgements for machine translation systems.
Since then, many other neural metrics have introduced in MT, e.g. [Comet](#rei2020) and [] [MetricX](#juraska2023) and other NLG tasks.

## <a id="metrics-classification">Metrics Classification</a>
I divide the metrics into three categories:

1. Algorithmic: You use a predefined algorithm to compute score.
This heavily relies on the existence of some reference text.
1. Neural: You use neural network to assess the quality of your system.
This is usually used when algorithmic metrics are not good indicators any more.
1. Large Language Modelas a judge: As appears from its name, it is about using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess the quality of other systems.
They are used in assessing the quality of other LLMs in replying to user queries.

To illustrate further why we need neural and LLM metrics, let's consider the below table for interpreting the BLEU score.
It is copied from [this article](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/advanced/automl-evaluate) from Google Cloud about evaluating models.

<a id="interpret-bleu"></a>
| BLEU Score | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- |
| < 10 | Almost useless |
| 10 - 19 | Hard to get the gist |
| 20 - 29 | The gist is clear, but has significant grammatical errors |
| 30 - 40 | Understandable to good translations |
| 40 - 50 | High quality translations |
| 50 - 60 | Very high quality, adequate, and fluent translations |
| > 60 | Quality often better than human |

Based on the above table, the agreement between human translators seams in the range of 50+ BLEU scores.
This means that having systems that agree with human-made references all of scores greater than 50 can not be compared via BLEU scores.
In simpler terms, we have reached the limit in evaluating using BLEU and other algorithms for very high resource pairs, e.g. English French of 56 BLEU scores.
However, [(Freitag et al, 2021)](#freitag2021) has shown that crowd workers may not differentiate between human and machine translation.
Hence, necessitates the need for professional translators to assess the quality of recent MT systems, or complex neural models.

### <a id="algorithmic-metrics">Algorithmic Metrics</a>
The first category is algorithmic metrics.
Given model output and reference output, compute score indicating how relevant is the prediction to ground truth.

Here is a list of algorithmic metrics and tasks in which they are used:

* [BLEU](#papeneni2002): commonly used in MT and Text Summarization.
Since it has parameters that controls the computed scores, [(Post et al, 2018)](#post2018) introduced sacrebleu implementation to fix those parameters for more fair comparison among papers.
* ChrF++: recently used in MT.
It has been especially promoted in [No Language Left Behind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04672) paper.
* [ROUGE](#lin2004): Mostly used in text summarization, and can be used in MT.
It has variances including but not limited to: ROUGE-S and ROUGE-L.

#### <a id="bleu">BLEU</a>
BLEU is an algorithm to compare between syntactic attributes of generated translation and reference one.
I will focus on its attributes and leave the math to the papers [(Post et al, 2018)](#post2018) and python libraries.
Referring to the [BLEU interpretation table](#interpret-bleu), we need to understand two important attributes:

1. Lowerscore is worse for sure, and
1. higher score is not necessarily better.

To understand it, consider the below three sentences of reference and two possible translations.

<!--TODO: make a better example-->
* Reference: He is a great guy. He made my day.
* Translation 1 (T1): He is a great guy. He made me cheerful.
* Translation 2 (T2): He is a great boy. He made my day.
* Translation 3 (T3): He is playing basketball.

It is obvious that BLEU score of translation 2 (B2) is higher than that of translation 1 (B1) and both translations are significantly better than translation 3 of much lower score (B3).
BLEU score guarantees that very poor translation, less than 40 BLEU score, is truly worse than higher scores, i.e. since B3 < B1, then B3 for sure is worse than B1.
On the other side, B2>B1, in high range of BLEU score, does not necessarily mean that T2 is better than T1.
They are very comparable to reference translation, i.e. the quality is considered as if a human translator wrote it.

### <a id="neural-metrics">Neural Metrics</a>
Deep neural networks has been trained to score the quality of generations on given task.
Since algorithmic metrics fall short when there is no given reference or there might be a very large number of possible references, deep neural networks come to the rescue.
Example models include:

1. [BERT-Score](#zhang2019): The first neurla model to assess the quality of NLG models, to the best of knowledge.
1. Comet](#rei2020) and [Cometkiwi](#rei2022): neural models to assess the quality of outputs of MT systems.
1. Some other neural metrics participated in the competition in the following years are Google's MetricX [(Juraska et al, 2013)](#juraska2023), [(Juraska et al, 2024)](#juraska2024).

### <a id="eval-llm">Evaluating Large Language Models</a>
The third category of metrics is Large LAnguage Models  as a judge.
It is about prompting LLM to evaluate the response of another LLM and give scores.
Since we are in the hype of LLMs, expect that you find many works that I have not cited.
However, you may check survey by [(Chang et al, 2024)](#chang2024) when going deeper.
